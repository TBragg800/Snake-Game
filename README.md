## Description
 This project is a terminal snake game written in C++. It uses the ncurses library and was built following the JH & co. tutorial series which can be viewed at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAv2QsOZ4l4. This project was built for the purpose of learning and advancing my knowledge of C++. This code was written to be compatible with Mac operating systems.

## Installation
* Begin by cloning the repo locally.

## Usage
  After installation, the user should navigate to the project directory and run the command 'g++ -lncurses main.cpp' in the CLI. An executable file should now be available. Next, while still in the project directory, the user will execute the executable file by typing the command './a.out' in the CLI. Enjoy the game.
